# Image Detail Selector  ✂️

## About

This tool enables the user to select a certain part of an image by dragging a rectangle with the mouse. Then this rectangle can be resized by using the corner handles. The rectangle itself can also be dragged and moved around in the image area.

The naming of the repository and some elements anticipates that this tool has been made as a base for an image cropper function. Although that behavior is not implemented yet at this point.

## Dependencies

I used the npm package `react-image-crop` to create this solution. You can find details about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-crop).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
